# FLACtools
This repository includes tools to assist in nonlinear dynamic analyses performed in FLAC.
Tools in this respository include:
  1. Jupyter notebook to quickly convert and save ground motion data from the PEER-NGA database as velocity time histories in FLAC history format. The notebook also allows users to process ground motions including clipping, cosine tapering, and performing baseline corrections. [Open PEER_GM_Processing_4_FLAC.ipynb](PEER_GM_Processing_4_FLAC.ipynb)
  2. *More to come...*
